This repo hosts the Attn Markets documentation site (Next.js). It contains pages,
theme configuration, and documentation content for public or internal docs.

## Key Areas

- docs/: canonical agent-first docs and internal notes.
- components/: UI components for the docs site.
- public/: static assets.

## Interfaces
- Docs content should be authored in docs/ and surfaced via pages when needed.
- Use scripts/ for maintenance checks.
