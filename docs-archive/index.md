# Welcome to attn

attn builds **attnCredit**: a revolving credit engine for onchain businesses, repaid automatically from routed revenue.

At a high level:

- borrowers route fees into controlled revenue accounts,
- repayment is enforced through hard sweeps from routed cashflows,
- limits adjust dynamically as revenue stability changes,
- utilization discipline prevents permanent maxed-out borrowing,
- deterministic freeze/default modes protect capital when risk spikes.

attn also offers **attnUSD**, an LP share in managed credit pools with explicit risk and reporting.
