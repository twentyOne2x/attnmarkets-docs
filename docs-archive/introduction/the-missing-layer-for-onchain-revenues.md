# The Missing Layer for Onchain Revenues

Onchain systems make fee generation visible, but they do not automatically make those fees financeable.

The missing piece is a credit control layer that turns recurring onchain cashflows into underwritable, enforceable facilities.

## What is missing today

Most projects still run revenue in ways that are hard to finance:

- fee flows land in generic wallets,
- repayment priorities are not enforced,
- treasury and operating balances are mixed,
- there is limited lender-grade reporting on servicing behavior.

Even with public dashboards, capital providers often lack a clean, enforceable way to fund against those flows.

## What attn adds

attn focuses on that missing layer with **attnCredit**:

- controlled revenue-account routing,
- policy-bounded underwriting,
- automated repayment sweeps,
- deterministic stress and default modes,
- lender-grade tape and operations visibility.

This shifts the model from discretionary repayment to serviced repayment.

## Why this matters

When fee flows are controlled and serviceable, projects can access working capital without depending only on token sales or ad hoc bilateral financing.

Capital providers can evaluate exposure using:

- repayment behavior,
- concentration and volatility controls,
- documented incident and governance actions.
