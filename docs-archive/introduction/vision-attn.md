# Vision: attnCredit as the Revenue Credit Control Plane

attn's long-term role is to be the credit and servicing layer for onchain businesses with routed fee cashflows.

The product center is **attnCredit**:

- revenue-underwritten revolving facilities,
- enforced repayment via hard sweeps,
- dynamic limits and utilization discipline,
- deterministic stress controls,
- lender-grade reporting tape.

## 1. Product trajectory

attn scales in two explicitly separated lanes:

- **Pump lane (wedge):** high-yield, high-volatility, tightly capped, fully automated.
- **Settlement lane (serious):** conservative settlement liquidity facilities for issuer/treasury buyers.

These lanes are separate in early stages, with no capital commingling.

## 2. Why this path

- Pump lane proves controls and servicing on live flows.
- The same rails can be reused for settlement facilities.
- Live tape and incident discipline improve institutional financeability.

## 3. What borrowers get

- fast access to working capital against routed fees,
- transparent draw and repayment behavior,
- predictable policy responses under stress.

## 4. What LPs and credit partners get

- explicit sleeve-level exposure,
- deterministic control modes,
- recurring facility-level reporting,
- clear governance on caps and risk parameters.

## 5. What does not change

Across all lanes, attn remains centered on:

- controlled revenue accounts,
- enforceable repayment priority,
- policy-bounded underwriting,
- auditable servicing operations.
