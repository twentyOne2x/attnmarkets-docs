# Who attn Is For

attnCredit serves borrowers, LPs, and infrastructure partners who need enforceable credit operations against routed revenue.

## 1. Onchain fee businesses (borrowers)

Best fit for teams that have:

- recurring or high-frequency onchain fee flow,
- willingness to route fees through controlled vaults,
- need for faster working-capital access.

## 2. Liquidity providers and credit funds

Best fit for LPs that want:

- sleeve-specific credit exposure,
- deterministic control policies,
- lender-grade reporting and audit trails.

## 3. Issuer/treasury/capital-markets teams

Best fit for partners that need:

- settlement liquidity facilities,
- reconciled servicing outputs,
- operationally conservative underwriting profiles.

## 4. Launchpads and ecosystem operators

Best fit when partners want:

- embedded distribution for revenue-swept facilities,
- policy-bounded limits and controls,
- clean handoff into LP-facing reporting.

## 5. Product lane mapping

- **Pump lane:** rapid proving lane, higher volatility, tighter caps.
- **Settlement lane:** conservative lane, institutional buyer profile.

Early stages keep these lanes separated in capital and risk.
