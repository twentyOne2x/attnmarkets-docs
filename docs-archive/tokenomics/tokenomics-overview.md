# Tokenomics (Directional)

Tokenomics and governance are designed to support durable credit operations, not short-term incentive extraction.

## 1. Core principles

- prioritize solvency and servicing reliability,
- align incentives with long-term facility performance,
- keep lane-level risk accountability explicit,
- maintain transparent reporting standards.

## 2. LP economics

LP returns come from managed credit sleeve performance, including:

- facility fees and spreads,
- utilization and servicing behavior,
- realized losses and recoveries,
- reserve and policy decisions.

## 3. Governance scope

Governance should control:

- sleeve-level cap frameworks,
- parameter bands for borrowing-base and trigger logic,
- reserve and loss-allocation policy,
- reporting and incident-discipline standards.

## 4. Lane-aware policy

- **Pump lane:** higher-yield sleeve with tighter caps and stricter fast-response controls.
- **Settlement lane:** conservative sleeve with institutional reporting and underwriting constraints.

Early phases keep sleeves separated and non-commingled.

## 5. Long-term direction

As track record grows, governance can evaluate:

- controlled expansion of facility types,
- broader LP access modes,
- allocator frameworks across proven sleeves.
