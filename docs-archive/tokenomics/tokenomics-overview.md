# Tokenomics (Directional)

This page outlines the intended roles of a future **$attn** token.  
It is directional and not a commitment to specific parameters, launch timing, or token value.

---

## 1. High-level goals

The token is meant to:

- align long-term users, LPs, and risk managers,  
- subsidise borrowing and early integrations,  
- backstop and govern the risk system,  
- and share protocol economics with stakeholders.

It is not required to use attn as a borrower or LP in the base configuration.

## 2. Roles in the system

### 2.1 Incentives for borrowers

Projects that:

- route revenues into an attn revenue account, and  
- use advances or credit lines responsibly,

may receive:

- **upfront or streamed $attn grants**,  
- **interest rebates** paid in $attn that lower their effective APR,  
- preferential access to higher limits and longer tenors (subject to risk).

This is meant to:

- bootstrap adoption of revenue accounts,  
- incentivise transparent, recurring usage rather than one-off positions.

### 2.2 Incentives for LPs

LPs providing capital (via attnUSD and other PT/YT markets) may receive:

- **additional $attn emissions** based on:
  - duration of capital,  
  - risk bucket of exposure,  
  - helpful behaviours (e.g. participating in auctions, supporting distressed restructurings).

This creates:

- a way to tilt incentives towards underserved but high-potential segments,  
- a mechanism to reward LPs that stick through full cycles.

### 2.3 Governance and risk

$attn is intended to govern:

- risk framework and limits (per-sector, per-name caps, allowed products),  
- parameters for YT pricing curves, reserves, and insurance,  
- treasury usage and incentive schedules,  
- whitelisting / blacklisting of asset types, custodians, and infra.

The exact governance mechanism (token voting, council, veto layers, etc.) is to be designed conservatively, with:

- strong controls on parameter changes that affect risk,  
- clear emergency powers for halting new positions if needed.

### 2.4 Insurance and backstop

A portion of:

- protocol revenue (fees, spreads), and  
- token supply (via allocations or buybacks),

can be directed into an **insurance / safety module** that:

- absorbs a first layer of losses before attnUSD NAV is hit, or  
- participates in recapitalising the system after large shocks.

The exact split between:

- LPs,  
- token stakers,  
- and protocol treasury

will be decided as the system matures.

## 3. Indicative flows

Examples of flows that may involve $attn:

- Borrower pays fees in stablecoins → protocol revenue → split between:
  - attnUSD LPs (via higher NAV),  
  - protocol treasury,  
  - insurance fund,  
  - buyback-and-distribute or buyback-and-burn for $attn.  

- LP provides capital and stakes $attn in a “risk module” → earns:
  - share of protocol fees from the risk bucket,  
  - additional $attn rewards,  
  - but also bears a portion of losses.

All numbers and exact mechanisms here are indicative and will change with further design and feedback.

## 4. Disclosures

Until a final token design and legal review exist, this page should be treated as:

- a design intent,  
- not an offer, sale, or guarantee,  
- and not a description of any live or tradable asset.

Updates will be reflected here as the protocol and its community converge on a concrete tokenomics spec.
