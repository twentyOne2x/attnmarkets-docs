# Onchain Revenues Are Homeless

Onchain, we’ve nailed a few things:

- launching tokens in minutes,
- routing trades through DEXs,
- spinning up fee switches and revenue PDAs.

What we haven’t nailed is what happens **after** the revenues arrive.

Most onchain revenues today:

- land in a wallet or PDA “somewhere”,
- get moved around manually,
- often sit idle, untracked, and unused.

There is usually no:

- clear “business account” for those flows,
- way to pledge them as collateral for a line of credit,
- structured way for outside capital to buy a share of them.

So even serious projects end up funding themselves with:

- repeated token sales,
- ad-hoc OTC deals,
- or just under-investing because raising is too painful.

From the outside, LPs mostly see:

- token price,
- TVL,
- narratives,

but almost no standardized view of:

- **cashflows**,
- **income quality**,
- **loss rates** on revenue-backed credit.

The result is a strange disconnect:

- onchain activity is real,
- revenues are real,
- but those revenues behave like **homeless money**:
  - they live in arbitrary wallets,
  - they’re rarely treated as a first-class asset,
  - and they almost never anchor proper credit markets.

That’s the gap attn is built around:  
not “more yield farming”, but **banking the revenues themselves** so they can support credit and become investable.
