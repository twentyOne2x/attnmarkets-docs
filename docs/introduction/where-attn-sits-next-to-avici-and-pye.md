# Where attn Sits Next to Avici and Pye

attn doesn’t live in a vacuum. It makes more sense when seen next to other projects that are trying to make credit and yield less abstract.

Two especially relevant ones:

- **Avici** – internet banking for people.
- **Pye** – structured markets for staking yield.

attn focuses on a different object:  
**revenue from apps, creators, DAOs, and networks.**

## Avici: internet banking for people

**Avici** is building a distributed internet neobank:

- cards and accounts,
- on/off-ramps,
- an onchain **Trust Score** to unlock credit,  
- and, ultimately, the ability to live onchain without needing a legacy retail bank.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

Their primary customer is:

- a person or SME that wants:
  - to spend globally,
  - keep assets self-custodied,
  - and still access familiar banking primitives.

**attn** looks at a different level:

- the **projects and businesses themselves**:
  - apps,
  - creator economies,
  - DAOs,
  - DePIN networks,
- and asks:
  - “where do your revenues go?”
  - “how do you fund yourself from them?”
  - “how can outside capital own a slice of that income?”

If Avici is about **banking individuals**,  
attn is about **banking the revenue streams of onchain businesses**.

## Pye: deals on staking yield vs deals on revenue

**Pye** focuses on Solana staking:

- validators issue structured positions,
- stakers can decompose them into:
  - a “principal” component,
  - a “yield” component,
- and trade or hold whichever piece they care about most.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

The underlying risk there is:

- stake performance,
- MEV and rewards,
- validator behavior.

attn uses a similar mental model but with:

- **protocol and creator revenues** as the underlying,
- not staking rewards.

Where Pye lets you do deals around **future staking income**,  
attn lets you do deals around **future protocol and creator income**:

- revenue advances,
- revenue-backed credit,
- and pooled revenue yield via a USD token.

## Why this distinction matters

All three projects care about:

- credit,
- yield,
- onchain underwriting.

They just touch different layers:

- **Avici** – you as a person: cards, accounts, unsecured and secured retail credit.
- **Pye** – your stake: validator deals and yield-splits on staked assets.
- **attn** – your project’s revenues: advances, credit lines, and pooled yield on app/creator income.

If you are:

- trying to live onchain as an individual → look at Avici.
- trying to optimize how staking yield is sliced and traded → look at Pye.
- trying to fund an app/DAO/creator business from its own revenues, or allocate capital into those revenues → attn is the relevant layer.
