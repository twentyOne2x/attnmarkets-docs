# Who attn Is For

attn is opinionated about who it serves.  
The docs are structured around four main groups.

---

## 1. Apps, DAOs & builders

“I run something with real users and revenues.”

Examples:

- DEXs, lending markets, infra protocols,
- DAOs owning treasuries and products,
- SaaS-like crypto apps charging usage revenues.

What you want:

- non-dilutive funding,
- better use of protocol income,
- credible ways to show your revenue stream is under control.

## 2. Creators, devs & memecoin CTOs

“I launched a token or revenue stream around a community, and I want to build something real on top.”

Examples:

- Pump.fun or similar creators,
- small teams with a meme that stuck,
- creator-token projects with recurring revenues.

What you want:

- to fund work without dumping,
- to turn creator rewards into budget,
- to show your community how money will be used.

## 3. Launchpads & incubators

“I help projects launch and want to offer real credit products on top.”

Examples:

- launchpads and incubators,
- project studios,
- vertical networks that spin up multiple products.

What you want:

- to plug “revenue-backed credit” into your launch template,
- to use vesting + future revenue to support bigger tickets for your best teams,
- to earn a share of the financing stack.

## 4. Liquidity providers

“I bring capital and care about real cashflows.”

Examples:

- funds and DAOs,
- sophisticated individuals,
- treasuries that want exposure to credit, not just price action.

What you want:

- a clear picture of:
  - what backs the USD yield token,
  - how defaults and recoveries work,
  - how diversified the book is.

You can stay entirely in your persona lane and never touch the mechanics,  
or you can go deeper when you are ready:
