# For Apps, DAOs & Builders

This page is for people who run:

- a protocol or dApp,
- a DAO with real revenues,
- or any onchain business that collects revenues.

## What you get from attn

For you, attn is mainly three things:

1. A **revenue account** for your app or DAO.  
2. **Revenue advances** – trade a slice of future income for cash now.  
3. **Revenue-backed credit lines** – ongoing borrowing capacity that repays from revenues.

You can use these to fund:

- liquidity,
- development,
- marketing,
- acquisitions,
- or anything else your DAO votes for.

## 1. Revenue account

You point your protocol revenues to a **revenue account** controlled by:

- your DAO or multisig,
- and attn (dual control on configuration),

with clear rules:

- When **no loan is open**:
  - you can move funds freely.
- When **a loan is open**:
  - a fixed share of incoming revenues goes first to repayment.

This turns your revenue stream into a clean, predictable asset that credit can be built on.

## 2. Revenue advances

When you know your app is producing steady revenues but you do not want to do a token sale, you can request:

- a **one-off advance** against a defined slice of future revenues.

You choose:

- how big a slice (e.g. 20–40%),
- how long (e.g. 3, 6, 12 months).

attn or outside capital pays you upfront and collects that slice of income until the deal is settled.

<summary>Example – DAO funds a new product line</summary>

- Your DEX earns roughly $80k/month in net revenues.  
- The DAO wants $200k to fund a new product and listings.

You propose:

- selling **30%** of the next **9 months** of net revenues.

Rough expectation:

- 9 × $80k = $720k total.  
- 30% slice = $216k.

attn offers:

- $200k upfront in exchange for that slice,  
- and collects 30% of net revenues until $216k has been routed to repayment.

DAO decision:

- trade 30% of 9 months of revenue for $200k now,  
- without issuing new governance tokens.

## 3. Revenue-backed credit lines

For ongoing needs, you can apply for a **credit line**:

- sized according to:
  - your revenue track record,
  - volatility,
  - diversification.

You get:

- a maximum limit in USD terms,
- an agreed repayment share of revenues,
- the ability to draw and repay flexibly within those parameters.

It behaves like a revolving facility in corporate banking, except:

- your “covenants” are enforced by how revenues are routed through your revenue account.

For larger tickets or earlier-stage projects, this line can combine:

- revenue commitments once live,
- plus vesting token collateral if you and a launchpad agree.

## What changes for users and token holders?

From your users’ perspective:

- Nothing about trading or interacting with your protocol must change.  
- The main change is where your **fee revenue** lands and how it is managed.

You should communicate to your community:

- that you are:
  - treating revenues as a formal financial asset,
  - avoiding unnecessary token sales,
  - funding growth with income first.
