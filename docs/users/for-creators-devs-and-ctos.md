# For Creators, Devs & Memecoin CTOs

This page is for:

- Pump.fun creators,
- devs who launched a meme that refuses to die,
- creator-token founders,
- small teams building around a community token.

---

## Your situation

You have:

- a token with real volume and a community,
- creator or protocol fees coming in,
- and a list of things you wish you could fund:
  - content,
  - features,
  - marketing,
  - events.

But:

- selling large chunks of your token feels wrong,
- banks do not care about your meme or your address history.

attn gives you a way to:

- **turn your fees into a funding tool**, without dumping.

---

## What you get

### 1. A “real” revenue account for your token

After you use a CTO or similar process (Pump.fun etc.), fees are routed to a joint account:

- controlled by:
  - you / your DAO,
  - and attn (for configuration),

with rules such as:

- if **no advance or loan is open**, you can withdraw fees freely,
- if **an advance or loan is open**, a set share of fees repays it first.

This sets you up to be taken seriously by:

- your community,
- potential LPs,
- and launchpads.

---

### 2. One-off advances (“sell a slice of your fees”)

You can:

- sell a portion of your expected fees over a chosen period for cash now.

You choose:

- how much of your future fees to sell (e.g. 25–35%),
- for how long (e.g. 3–9 months),

and attn quotes how much you can get today.

<details>
<summary>Example – Pump token funds a simple game</summary>

- Your token’s creator rewards average ~50 SOL/day.  
- You want 600 SOL to:
  - pay a dev,
  - build a simple game,
  - seed some extra liquidity.

You opt to sell:

- **30%** of your next **120 days** of fees.

Estimates:

- 120 × 50 SOL = 6,000 SOL total.  
- 30% slice = 1,800 SOL.

attn or a fund offers:

- 600 SOL upfront,
- in exchange for receiving 30% of your creator fees until 1,800 SOL has been routed to them.

You trade 30% of 4 months of future fees for 600 SOL today,  
without selling your own token.

### 3. Credit lines as your project matures

Once you have stable fees:

- you can apply for a **credit line** instead of only one-off deals.

This is most relevant when:

- you have moved beyond pure meme,
- you have:
  - products,
  - recurring revenue,
  - real expenses.

The line:

- grows with your revenue track record,
- repays automatically from your fees,
- can be combined with vesting token collateral for larger tickets.

---

## What about vesting tokens?

For bigger tickets, especially via a launchpad, you might:

- offer a portion of your **vesting tokens** as extra collateral.

This is usually done in partnership with:

- a launchpad,
- your DAO (if applicable),
- and attn.

The goal is:

- let you access more capital earlier,
- while still anchoring repayment in future fees once they exist.

## What changes for your holders?

You should make it explicit to your community:

- what share of future fees you are selling or using to repay a loan,
- what you are using the cash for,
- and how this helps the project grow.

From their perspective, if done well:

- tokens represent a project with:
  - real revenue,
  - a clear funding plan,
  - and transparent commitments around fees.

attn is the infrastructure that makes those commitments enforceable onchain.
