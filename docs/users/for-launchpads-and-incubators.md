# For Launchpads & Incubators

This page is for:

- launchpads and incubators,
- project studios,
- anyone who helps projects:
  - launch tokens,
  - raise capital,
  - structure vesting and fee switches.

## What you get from attn

attn gives you a way to:

1. Offer **revenue-backed financing** as a native part of your launchpad.  
2. Combine **vesting tokens** and **future fee commitments** into structured deals.  
3. Share in the economics of:
   - advances,
   - credit lines,
   - and yield products built on top of your best projects.

## 1. Revenue accounts at launch

At launch, you can:

- create a standard template where:
  - a project’s **fee switch** points into an **attn revenue account**,
  - controlled by:
    - project team / DAO,
    - you (if you are part of governance),
    - and attn (for financing configuration).

From day one, this makes the project:

- “credit-ready” as soon as it has fees,
- with no painful migration later.

---

## 2. Offer revenue advances to your top projects

As projects gain traction, you can route them into standard deals:

- **short-term advances**:
  - trade 20–40% of the next 3–12 months of fees,
  - for marketing, product, or expansion budget.
- **longer revenue-sharing deals**:
  - where a slice of revenues supports multi-year credit.

Your benefits:

- better outcomes for the strongest teams,
- a share of the interest and fees,
- a tangible differentiator vs other launchpads.

<summary>Example – Launchpad-led revenue advance</summary>

Project “ALPHA”:

- launched through your pad,
- now generates ~$300k/year in net protocol income.

You design a “Launchpad Advance” template:

- up to 40% of 1-year future fees can be sold,
- attn provides pricing and risk limits.

ALPHA opts to:

- sell 30% of 1-year projected fees.

attn’s capital provides the cash,  
you share in the economics,  
and ALPHA gets non-dilutive funding sourced from its own revenue.

## 3. Vesting + revenue hybrid loans (bigger tickets)

Some projects will want larger tickets **before** their revenues are mature. For them, you can help structure:

- hybrid deals where:
  - an agreed portion of **vesting tokens** is escrowed,
  - plus a commitment to route future fees into their revenue account once live.

This allows:

- a bigger upfront loan,
- but still remains anchored in future income, not just token price.

attn will:

- set conservative haircuts on vesting tokens,
- require fee routing once the protocol is live,
- and treat revenue performance as the primary basis for future refinancings.

## 4. DePIN and machine revenue (later-stage patterns)

In later integrations (see `use-cases/icm-launchpads-and-depin.md`), attn can also be applied to:

- machine revenue from DePIN networks,  
- where devices and protocols generate onchain income.

For you as a launchpad:

- this means you can support:
  - token launches,
  - plus financing of real-world machine fleets via revenue bonds.

The core docs here stay focused on:

- how to plug your launchpad into attn,
- how to offer revenue-based credit within your existing flows.

---

## 5. Operational integration

To use attn smoothly, you will want:

- a **“Connect to attn”** step in your launch workflows,
- standard docs explaining:
  - what share of fees may be pledged,
  - what happens in defaults or underperformance,
- lightweight review with attn on:
  - which projects qualify,
  - how vesting escrow is implemented.
