# attn.markets – Revenue-Native Credit on Solana

**Solana-native “revenue bank” that turns onchain income into bankable collateral via governed revenue accounts, revenue-backed financing, and a pooled USD share token (attnUSD).**

---
Positioning: compared to Avici.money (personal banking) and Pye.fi (staking-yield PT/YT), attn banks apps / creators / DAOs by slicing protocol & creator revenues into PT/YT-backed credit.

---

## Product

- Turns protocol / creator / network revenues into a governed **revenue account**, **revenue-backed advances & credit lines**, and a **USD share token (attnUSD)** backed by those positions.  
- No KYC, no bank linking, no credit scores: everything is sized and enforced on observable **onchain revenues** in jointly governed vaults.

---

## What It Enables & For Whom

- **Apps, DAOs, Creators** – Route earnings fees into a revenue account to access non-dilutive advances / revolving credit lines and earn base yield on idle balances.  
- **Liquidity Providers (funds, DAOs, individuals)** – Deposit stables for **attnUSD**, getting diversified exposure to revenue-backed credit and associated yield.  
- **Cards / Commerce / BNPL Partners** – Use attn as a revenue-backed credit engine behind cards, wallets, merchant advances, and B2B net terms at the entity level.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Solana-native revenue accounts** as governed Squads vaults, separate from operating wallets.  
- **Fixed-income layer** using Exponent's infrastructure for PT/YT on revenue-bearing positions.  
- **attnUSD vault** holding stablecoins plus PT/YT, with conservative operator-led risk limits.

## Vision

attn makes onchain revenues behave like a bank account and credit line your project can actually live on: route protocol and creator income into a governed revenue account, turn it into reusable credit, and use that credit to fund builds, pay contributors, top up cards, and offer BNPL / net terms, while LPs hold a single pooled USD token backed by those revenue streams.

---

## Roadmap

Start with guarded mainnet revenue accounts, short advances, and a small curated attnUSD book; then layer in credit lines, launchpad templates, and key spend integrations (cards / commerce / BNPL / streams) over time.

---

## Tokenomics

A future **$attn** token is meant to align borrowers, LPs, and risk governance via incentives and fee-sharing, and remains optional for using the core products.
