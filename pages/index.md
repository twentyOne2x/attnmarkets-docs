# Welcome to attn

attn turns onchain **revenues** into something familiar:

- revenue-backed **cash advances**,  
- **credit lines** that repay from your earnings,  
- a **revenue account** that can also earn on idle balances,  
- and attnUSD, a **USD yield token** backed by those revenues.

You can think of attn as:

> A revenue bank for apps, creators, DAOs, and networks.

Instead of only selling tokens or doing custom OTC deals, attn lets you:

- route your **revenue stream** into a dedicated revenue account,  
- unlock **upfront cash** or a **revolving credit line**,  
- let outside capital earn yield from your success via attnUSD,  
- and keep unencumbered revenues working in simple onchain yield.
