# attn in context: adjacent protocols and fintech layers

attn is easiest to understand when seen next to other projects working on credit, payments, yield, and underwriting.

attn's focus is **attnCredit**: revolving credit for onchain businesses, repaid automatically from **routed onchain revenue accounts**.

## Revenue & receivables credit (zoom-in)

This first map is the anchor view for attn's closest comparator lane: revenue and receivables credit.
Axes are remapped to emphasize **repayment enforceability** and **servicing intelligence**.
Use two simple commercial lenses here:

- **Borrower type:** business vs consumer
- **Distribution model:** platform-native vs partner-embedded network

`B2B2SMB` is shorthand for partner-embedded business financing (for example, YouLend distributed via partner platforms).

<QuadrantScatterMap asOf="2026-02-21" preset="revenue_receivables_zoom" maxWidth={900} />

### Quick read (commercial model)

- **Platform-native B2SMB:** Stripe Capital, PayPal Working Capital, Shopify Capital, Square Loans
- **Partner-embedded B2B2SMB:** YouLend, Parafin, Liberis
- **Direct B2SMB originators:** Pipe, Clearco, Wayflyer, Uncapped
- **Onchain control references (not a cluster):** attn, creditcoop.xyz

- **Execution plane means where enforcement actually happens, not where the UI is.**

## Market segments (grouped by narrative)

As of **2026-02-21**, this is a practical BD map, not perfect taxonomy.

### 1) Enforcement-first entity credit (revenue / receivables)

- **attn (attnCredit)**
- **creditcoop.xyz**
- **YouLend**
- **Parafin**
- **Liberis**
- **Pipe**
- **Clearco**
- **Wayflyer**
- **Uncapped**
- **PayPal Working Capital**
- **Shopify Capital**
- **Stripe Capital**
- **Square Loans**

### 2) Provider-of-providers issuing + settlement infrastructure

- **Rain**

### 3) Embedded credit rails (credit-as-a-feature)

- **Yumi.finance**

### 4) Agent-native credit + spend surfaces

- **claw.credit**
- **Frames (frames.ag/tools)**
- **Sponge (paysponge.com)**

### 5) Market-based credit + debt issuance

- **Wildcat.finance**
- **3Jane.xyz**
- **Xitadel.fi**

### 6) Consumer spend surfaces

- **Krak (Kraken)**
- **Avici.money**
- **Pyra.fi**
- **KAST (kast.xyz)**
- **OffGrid (offgrid.cash)**

### 7) Business money surfaces (distribution endpoints)

- **Slash**
- **Squads Altitude**

### 8) B2B2C BNPL + payments rails

- **Klarna + Tempo**
- **Affirm**
- **Colossus.credit**

### 9) Adjacent (not primarily credit)

- **Pye.fi** (tokenized principal/yield claims on staked validator revenue streams)

## 3 BD takeaways

- **attn is a control layer:** underwriting + servicing + enforceability rails around routed revenue.
- **attn targets entity-level revenue risk, not consumer-credit distribution.**
- **attn can sit behind cards, commerce, treasury, and agent spend surfaces** as working-capital and settlement-liquidity infrastructure.

## attn fit by segment

### Revenue/receivables credit

Credit Coop, YouLend, Parafin, Liberis, Pipe, Clearco, Wayflyer, Uncapped, PayPal Working Capital, Shopify Capital, Stripe Capital, and Square Loans are closest on core mechanic (revenue-aligned repayment), but differ by rails and distribution posture.

Stripe Capital, PayPal Working Capital, and Shopify Capital are **platform-native merchant financing** (business borrower inside their own platform ecosystems). YouLend is **partner-embedded business financing** (`B2B2SMB` shorthand), not consumer lending.

### Agent economy surfaces

Frames and Sponge are spend/control surfaces. claw.credit is credit execution. These can consume a back-end credit+servicing layer when routed revenue exists.

### Distribution surfaces

Krak, Avici, Pyra, Slash, and Altitude are where end-users or operators interact. They are generally complements, not direct substitutes, for attn's control-plane position.

### Market and rails narratives

Wildcat/3Jane/Xitadel emphasize market or issuance models; Klarna+Tempo and Affirm are B2B2C BNPL distribution (merchant-integrated, shopper-facing), while Colossus emphasizes a payments-rails narrative. attn's differentiator remains enforceable servicing around routed revenue accounts.
