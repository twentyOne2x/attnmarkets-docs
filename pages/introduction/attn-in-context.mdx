# attn in context: adjacent protocols and fintech layers

attn is easiest to understand when seen next to other projects working on credit, payments, yield, and underwriting.

attn's focus is **attnCredit**: revolving credit for onchain businesses, repaid automatically from **routed onchain revenue accounts**.

## Revenue & receivables credit (zoom-in)

This first map is the anchor view for attn's closest comparator lane: revenue and receivables credit.
It is intentionally narrow, so you can quickly compare the firms most similar to attn on repayment behavior and servicing quality.
Use two simple commercial lenses to read it:

- **Borrower type:** business vs consumer
- **Distribution model:** platform-native vs partner-embedded network

`B2B2SMB` is shorthand for partner-embedded business financing (for example, YouLend distributed via partner platforms).

<QuadrantScatterMap asOf="2026-02-21" preset="revenue_receivables_zoom" maxWidth={900} />

### Quick read (commercial model)

- **Platform-native B2SMB:** Stripe Capital, PayPal Working Capital, Shopify Capital, Square Loans
- **Partner-embedded B2B2SMB:** YouLend, Parafin, Liberis
- **Direct B2SMB originators:** Pipe, Clearco, Wayflyer, Uncapped
- **Onchain control references (not a cluster):** attn, creditcoop.xyz

## Wider strategic credit, spend, and settlement map

This second map zooms out and places that first lane inside the broader market context.
It includes adjacent credit, spend, treasury, issuance, and payments-rail narratives so it is easier to separate direct substitutes from complements.
Use this view for partner mapping and BD prioritization, not just direct competitor ranking.

## 3 BD takeaways

- **attn is a control layer:** underwriting + servicing + enforceability rails around routed revenue.
- **attn targets entity-level revenue risk, not consumer-credit distribution.**
- **attn can sit behind cards, commerce, treasury, and agent spend surfaces** as working-capital and settlement-liquidity infrastructure.

## attn fit by segment

### Revenue/receivables credit

 **Credit Coop**, **YouLend**, **Parafin**, **Liberis**, **Pipe**, **Clearco**, **Wayflyer**, **Uncapped**, **PayPal Working Capital**, **Shopify Capital**, **Stripe Capital**, and **Square Loans** are closest on core mechanic (revenue-aligned repayment), but differ by rails and distribution posture.

 **Stripe Capital**, **PayPal Working Capital**, and **Shopify Capital** are **platform-native merchant financing** (business borrower inside their own platform ecosystems). **YouLend** is **partner-embedded business financing** (`B2B2SMB` shorthand), not consumer lending.

### Agent economy surfaces

 **Frames** and **Sponge** are spend/control surfaces. **claw.credit** is credit execution. These can consume a back-end credit+servicing layer when routed revenue exists.

### Distribution surfaces

 **Krak**, **Avici**, **Pyra**, **Slash**, and **Altitude** are where end-users or operators interact. They are generally complements, not direct substitutes, for attn's control-plane position.

### Market and rails narratives

 **Wildcat**/**3Jane**/**Xitadel** emphasize market or issuance models; **Klarna + Tempo** and **Affirm** are B2B2C BNPL distribution (merchant-integrated, shopper-facing), while **Colossus.credit** emphasizes a payments-rails narrative. attn's differentiator remains enforceable servicing around routed revenue accounts.
