# attn in context: adjacent protocols and fintech layers

attn is easiest to understand when seen next to other projects working on credit, payments, yield, and underwriting.

attn's focus is **attnCredit**: revenue-underwritten, onchain-enforced revolving credit and servicing against **routed onchain revenue accounts**.

- **Execution plane means where enforcement actually happens, not where the UI is.**

## The comparison set (grouped by narrative)

As of **2026-02-21**, this is a practical BD map, not perfect taxonomy.

### 1) Enforcement-first entity credit (revenue / receivables)

- **attn (attnCredit)**
- **creditcoop.xyz**
- **YouLend**
- **Pipe**

### 2) Provider-of-providers issuing + settlement infrastructure

- **Rain**

### 3) Embedded credit rails (credit-as-a-feature)

- **Yumi.finance**

### 4) Agent-native credit + spend surfaces

- **claw.credit**
- **Frames (frames.ag/tools)**
- **Sponge (paysponge.com)**

### 5) Market-based credit + debt issuance

- **Wildcat.finance**
- **3Jane.xyz**
- **Xitadel.fi**

### 6) Consumer spend surfaces

- **Krak (Kraken)**
- **Avici.money**
- **Pyra.fi**
- **KAST (kast.xyz)**
- **OffGrid (offgrid.cash)**

### 7) Business money surfaces (distribution endpoints)

- **Slash**
- **Altitude (Squads.xyz)**

### 8) Payments rails / payments-L1 narratives

- **Klarna + Tempo**
- **Colossus.credit**

### 9) Adjacent (not primarily credit)

- **Pye.fi** (tokenized principal/yield claims on staked validator revenue streams)

## 3 quick takeaways

- **attn is a control layer:** underwriting + servicing + enforceability rails around routed revenue.
- **attn targets entity-level revenue risk, not consumer-credit distribution.**
- **attn can sit behind cards, commerce, treasury, and agent spend surfaces** as working-capital and settlement-liquidity infrastructure.

## attn relevance by cluster

### Revenue/receivables credit

Credit Coop, YouLend, and Pipe are closest on core mechanic (revenue-aligned repayment), but differ by rails and regulatory wrapper.

### Agent economy surfaces

Frames and Sponge are spend/control surfaces. claw.credit is credit execution. These can consume a back-end credit+servicing layer when routed revenue exists.

### Distribution surfaces

Krak, Avici, Pyra, Slash, and Altitude are where end-users or operators interact. They are generally complements, not direct substitutes, for attn's control-plane position.

### Market and rails narratives

Wildcat/3Jane/Xitadel emphasize market or issuance models; Klarna+Tempo/Colossus emphasize payments rails. attn's differentiator remains enforceable servicing around routed revenue accounts.
