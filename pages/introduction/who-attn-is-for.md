# Who attn Is For

attn is designed for a specific set of users.  

It is **Solana-native and onchain-only**:
- no bank accounts
- no credit scores
- no real-world asset verification
- no KYC

The docs are organised around five main groups.

---

## 1. Apps, DAOs & builders

“I run something with real users and revenues.”

Examples:

- DEXs, lending markets, infra protocols  
- DAOs owning treasuries and products  
- SaaS-like crypto apps charging usage-based revenues

Typical goals:

- non-dilutive financing  
- better use of protocol income (including earning on idle balances)  
- credible ways to show that the revenue stream is under control

## 2. Creators, devs & memecoin CTOs

“I launched a token or revenue stream around a community, and I want to build something real on top.”

Examples:

- Pump.fun devs or similar creators  
- small teams with a meme that stuck  
- creator-token projects with recurring revenues

Typical goals:

- finance your lifestyle from a rolling credit line backed by your earnings  
- fund work without dumping  
- turn creator rewards into a working budget  
- let earnings parked in a revenue account earn simple yield when idle  
- show the community how earnings are used

## 3. Launchpads & incubators

“I help projects launch and want to offer real credit products on top.”

Examples:

- launchpads and incubators  
- project studios  
- vertical networks that spin up multiple products

Typical goals:

- plug **revenue-backed credit** into your launch template  
- use vesting + future revenue to support larger tickets for your best teams  
- earn a share of the financing stack  
- offer projects a standard way to route revenues, earn on idle balances, and access credit

## 4. Liquidity providers

“I bring capital and care about real cashflows.”

Examples:

- funds and DAOs  
- sophisticated individuals  
- treasuries that want exposure to credit, not just token price

Typical goals:

- a clear picture of:
  - what backs the attnUSD yield token  
  - how defaults and recoveries work  
  - how diversified the book is  
- a way to own a diversified slice of revenue-backed credit (and, in some products, the underlying base yield on pledged assets)

## 5. Cards, commerce & BNPL partners

“I run cards, checkouts, or B2B billing and want credit that is funded by onchain revenues, not unsecured consumer loans.”

Examples:

- card programs and wallets (USDC cards, Kast, Avici, etc.)  
- travel and rewards platforms  
- merchant networks and marketplaces  
- B2B SaaS and infra providers offering usage-based billing and net terms  
- BNPL / checkout providers who want their limits to grow with merchant or platform revenues

Typical goals:

- offer cards and wallets whose limits grow with project revenues  
- fund instalments, net terms, and invoice BNPL from **entity-level revenue-backed facilities**  
- keep all consumer KYC, UX, and receivables on the partner’s stack  
- share in the economics of revenue-backed credit
