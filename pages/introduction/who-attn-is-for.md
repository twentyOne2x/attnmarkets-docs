# Who attn Is For

attn is designed for a specific set of users.  
The docs are organised around four main groups.

---

## 1. Apps, DAOs & builders

“I run something with real users and revenues.”

Examples:

- DEXs, lending markets, infra protocols,  
- DAOs owning treasuries and products,  
- SaaS-like crypto apps charging usage-based revenues.

Typical goals:

- non-dilutive funding,  
- better use of protocol income,  
- credible ways to show that the revenue stream is under control.

## 2. Creators, devs & memecoin CTOs

“I launched a token or revenue stream around a community, and I want to build something real on top.”

Examples:

- Pump.fun devs or similar creators,  
- small teams with a meme that stuck,  
- creator-token projects with recurring revenues.

Typical goals:

- finance your lifestyle from a rolling credit line backed by your earnings,
- fund work without dumping,  
- turn creator rewards into a working budget,  
- show the community how earnings are used.

## 3. Launchpads & incubators

“I help projects launch and want to offer real credit products on top.”

Examples:

- launchpads and incubators,  
- project studios,  
- vertical networks that spin up multiple products.

Typical goals:

- plug **revenue-backed credit** into your launch template,  
- use vesting + future revenue to support larger tickets for your best teams,  
- earn a share of the financing stack.

## 4. Liquidity providers

“I bring capital and care about real cashflows.”

Examples:

- funds and DAOs,  
- sophisticated individuals,  
- treasuries that want exposure to credit, not just token price.

Typical goals:

- a clear picture of:
  - what backs the attnUSD yield token,  
  - how defaults and recoveries work,  
  - how diversified the book is.
