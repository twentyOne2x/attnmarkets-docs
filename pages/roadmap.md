# Roadmap (Tentative)

This roadmap is indicative. Timelines, scope, and sequencing can change as the market and data evolve.

---

## Phase 0 – Internal pilots and infra

Focus:

- Build and test the core pieces with a very small set of projects.

Milestones:

- CreatorVault / revenue account live on devnet.  
- Integration with Squads for 2-of-2 or similar governance.  
- Exponent-style PT/YT infrastructure wired to represent revenue positions.  
- attnUSD vault skeleton with manual risk controls.

---

## Phase 1 – Guarded mainnet and curated book

Focus:

- Move to mainnet in a controlled way, with conservative risk and limited counterparties.

Milestones:

- Guarded mainnet launch of revenue accounts.  
- First cohort of apps / creators routing revenues into attn accounts.  
- One-off revenue advances with short tenors and tight caps.  
- attnUSD live with limited external access (whitelisted LPs, capped TVL).  
- Basic risk and limits framework enforced off-chain + on-chain guards.

---

## Phase 2 – Credit lines, base yield, and launchpad integrations

Focus:

- Broader product surface, better UX, and more integrated flows.

Milestones:

- Revenue-backed credit lines for projects with stable earnings.  
- Base yield on idle balances in revenue accounts (SOL staking / yield-bearing stables).  
- Launchpad integrations:
  - “Connect to attn” at launch,  
  - standard templates for fee routing and vesting + revenue hybrid positions.  
- Expanded LP base with clear risk disclosures and reporting.

---

## Phase 3 – Secondary markets and structured products

Focus:

- Deepen liquidity and composability of PT/YT and attnUSD.

Milestones:

- Select PT/YT pairs enabled for secondary liquidity.  
- RFQ or AMM-based markets for specific revenue bonds.  
- Insurance / safety module live with first-loss capital.  
- Basic structured products:
  - PT-only pools,  
  - sector-focused sleeves within attnUSD.  

---

## Phase 4 – Ecosystem integrations and governance handoff

Focus:

- Make the revenue layer a default primitive and decentralise key decisions.

Milestones:

- Integrations with other Solana and cross-chain protocols that understand PT/YT and attnUSD.  
- Wider set of use cases:
  - DePIN and machine revenue,  
  - offchain businesses bridging revenues onchain.  
- Progressive governance rollout for $attn holders or designated councils.  
- Clear, ongoing reporting on:
  - portfolio performance,  
  - losses and recoveries,  
  - parameter changes.

This roadmap is not a promise; it is a map of how attn aims to become default infrastructure for onchain revenues if product–market fit and risk discipline hold.
