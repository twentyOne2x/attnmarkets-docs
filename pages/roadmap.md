# Roadmap (Indicative)

This roadmap prioritizes live proof of controls, then institutional scaling.

## Phase 0 - Control plane and pilot servicing

- revenue-account routing templates and validation,
- sweep executor and utilization-discipline enforcement,
- baseline monitoring, reconciliation, and incident logging,
- pilot facilities with tight policy caps.

## Phase 1 - Pump lane proving ground

- launch high-volatility credit pool with strict limits,
- run deterministic throttle/freeze/default playbooks,
- collect repeatable lender tape and drill evidence,
- iterate parameter bands from live outcomes.

## Phase 2 - Lane hardening and reporting maturity

- expand reporting cadence and loan-level disclosures,
- tighten governance over caps, reserves, and trigger bands,
- improve stress-mode automation and exception handling,
- deepen LP tooling for credit-pool-level oversight.

## Phase 3 - Settlement lane onboarding

- onboard issuer/treasury-style settlement liquidity facilities,
- keep separate credit pool and underwriting box,
- publish institutional reporting pack expectations,
- formalize partner operating runbooks.

## Phase 4 - Scaled distribution and allocator layer

- broader partner distribution across ecosystems,
- potential allocator layer across proven credit pools,
- conservative expansion only after independent credit pool performance is established.
