## Phase 0 - Control plane and pilot servicing

- revenue-account routing templates and validation,
- sweep executor and utilization-discipline enforcement,
- baseline monitoring, reconciliation, and incident logging,
- pilot facilities with tight policy caps.

_If this is you: want an indicative limit + terms -> [Estimate credit line](https://app.attn.markets/credit-line)._

## Phase 1 - Pump lane proving ground

- launch high-volatility credit pool with strict limits,
- run deterministic throttle/freeze/default playbooks,
- collect repeatable lender tape and drill evidence,
- iterate parameter bands from live outcomes.

_If this is you: ready to route revenue + draw -> [Request access](https://attn.markets/request-access)._

## Phase 2 - Lane hardening and reporting maturity

- expand reporting cadence and loan-level disclosures,
- tighten governance over caps, reserves, and trigger bands,
- improve stress-mode automation and exception handling,
- deepen LP tooling for credit-pool-level oversight.

_If this is you: evaluating pool reporting + risk controls -> [For Liquidity Providers](./users/for-liquidity-providers.md)._

## Phase 3 - Settlement lane onboarding

- onboard issuer/treasury-style settlement liquidity facilities,
- keep separate credit pool and underwriting box,
- publish institutional reporting pack expectations,
- formalize partner operating runbooks.

_If this is you: exploring settlement-liquidity integration -> [For Cards, Commerce, and Settlement Partners](./users/for-cards-and-commerce-partners.md)._

## Phase 4 - Scaled distribution and allocator layer

- broader partner distribution across ecosystems,
- potential allocator layer across proven credit pools,
- conservative expansion only after independent credit pool performance is established.
