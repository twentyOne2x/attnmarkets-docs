attnCredit helps onchain teams finance operations against routed fee cashflows without relying only on token sales.

## What attn provides

1. **Controlled revenue accounts**
   Fee flows route into policy-governed vaults for enforceable servicing.
2. **Revenue-swept advances**
   Short-cycle upfront liquidity against defined repayment shares.
3. **Revenue-backed revolving facilities**
   Dynamic limits that adjust with observed performance and risk.

## How facilities are enforced

- hard sweeps prioritize repayment from routed fees,
- mandatory utilization discipline prevents indefinite maxed-out borrowing,
- dynamic limits tighten or expand with cashflow quality,
- deterministic throttle/freeze/default controls activate under stress.

## What this funds

Teams typically use proceeds for:

- product and infrastructure execution,
- growth and distribution,
- operating runway management,
- strategic initiatives approved by governance.

## Operating model

### Revenue account setup

Borrowers configure routing into controlled accounts and define policy-compatible operating permissions.

### Facility sizing

Limits are set using risk-adjusted trailing revenue, concentration, and volatility assumptions.

### Continuous servicing

Repayment and risk controls run continuously, with reporting outputs for operators and LPs.

## Lane strategy context

- **Pump lane:** higher-volatility profile with tighter caps and faster control reactions.
- **Settlement lane:** conservative profile for institutional settlement-liquidity use cases.

Early phases keep lane capital separated to avoid commingled risk.

## What to communicate to your community

Projects should be explicit about:

- what share of cashflows is pledged,
- how proceeds are used,
- what control policies govern stress behavior,
- how this reduces dependence on repeated token issuance.
