# For Pump.fun Creators, Devs, and Memecoin CTOs

This page is for teams with real onchain fee flow that need short-cycle working capital.

## Your situation

You have:

- recurring creator or protocol earnings,
- active build and distribution costs,
- a need to fund operations without repeatedly selling token inventory.

attnCredit helps convert routed earnings into an enforceable financing facility.

## What you get

### 1. Controlled revenue account

Your eligible earnings are routed into a configured revenue account with clear policy behavior:

- if no facility is active, withdrawals follow normal policy,
- if a facility is active, debt service sweeps are prioritized.

This makes repayment legible and auditable.

### 2. Revenue-swept advances

You can take a short-dated advance against a policy-defined share of expected earnings.

Typical use cases:

- funding content and growth cycles,
- paying contractors and infra costs,
- bridging short operating windows.

### 3. Scaling into revolving lines

As flow continuity improves, facilities can move from one-off advances to revolving usage:

- dynamic limits based on observed revenue,
- mandatory utilization discipline,
- deterministic throttle/freeze behavior under stress.

## Optional collateral extensions

For larger tickets, launchpad or DAO structures can add collateral overlays while keeping repayment anchored in routed earnings.

See: [For Launchpads & Incubators](./for-launchpads-and-incubators.md)

## What to communicate to your community

Teams should disclose:

- what share of routed earnings is pledged,
- what facility proceeds are used for,
- how policy controls protect repayment discipline.
