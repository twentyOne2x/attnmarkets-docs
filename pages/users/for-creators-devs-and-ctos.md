# For Creators, Devs & Memecoin CTOs

This page is for:

- Pump.fun creators
- devs whose meme refused to die
- creator-token founders
- small teams building around a community token

---

## Your situation

You have:

- a token with real volume and a community
- creator or protocol earnings coming in
- a list of things you want to fund:

  - content
  - features
  - marketing
  - events, tools, infra

But:

- selling large chunks of your token feels wrong
- banks do not care about your meme or your address history

attn gives you a way to **turn your earnings into a funding tool** instead of selling your own supply.

---

## What you get

### 1. A revenue account for your token

After you use a CTO or similar process (Pump.fun etc.), earnings are routed to a joint account:

- controlled by:

  - you / your DAO
  - and attn (for configuration),

with rules such as:

- if **no advance or loan is open**, you can withdraw earnings freely
- if **an advance or loan is open**, a set share of earnings repays it first

On top of that, the account can:

- place unencumbered earnings into simple onchain yield sources (e.g. staked SOL or yield-bearing stablecoins),
- so that your rewards earn something by default while still being available for spending or as collateral.

This makes your earnings:

- legible to partners and LPs
- easier to use as collateral
- easier to explain to your community

---

### 2. One-off advances (“sell a slice of your earnings”)

You can:

- sell a portion of your expected earnings over a chosen period for cash now.

You choose:

- how much of your future earnings to sell (e.g. 20–35%),
- for how long (typically up to a few weeks, sometimes a month),

and attn quotes how much you can get today.

<details>
<summary>Example – Fund a small build with 30 days of earnings</summary>

- Your token’s creator rewards average ~5 SOL/day.
- You want ~40–70 SOL to pay a dev and run a small campaign.

You opt to sell:

- **30%** of your next **30 days** of earnings.

Estimates:

- 30 × 5 SOL = 150 SOL total expected.
- 30% slice ≈ 45 SOL.

attn or a fund might offer:

- ~40 SOL upfront,
- in exchange for receiving 30% of your creator earnings until 45 SOL has been routed to them.

You trade a slice of ~1 month of earnings for ~40 SOL today,
without selling your own token.

</details>

These are short-dated, “bridge this month” style positions with fast payback from ongoing volume.

### 3. Credit lines as your project scales

Once your earnings are more predictable in size and frequency, you can apply for a **credit line** instead of only one-off positions.

This is most relevant when:

- your token (meme, utility, whatever you ship) has a steady baseline of volume and rewards
- you are running:

  - recurring content or product work
  - ongoing contributors and operations
  - a budget you want to reuse month over month

The line:

- grows with your revenue track record and size
- repays automatically from your earnings
- can be combined with vesting token collateral for larger tickets

At that point, a revolving limit is usually more convenient than repeatedly opening new short advances.

---

## What about vesting tokens?

For bigger tickets, especially via a launchpad, you might:

- offer a portion of your **vesting tokens** as extra collateral.

This is usually done in partnership with:

- a launchpad
- your DAO (if applicable)
- and attn

The goal is:

- to let you access more capital earlier,
- while still anchoring repayment in future earnings once they exist.

## What changes for your holders?

You should make it explicit to your community:

- what share of future earnings you are selling or using to repay a loan
- what you are using the cash for
- how this helps the project grow

From their perspective, if done well, tokens represent a project with:

- real revenue
- a clear funding plan
- transparent commitments around earnings

attn provides the infrastructure that makes those commitments enforceable onchain, and gives you a default place to park and grow earnings between decisions.
