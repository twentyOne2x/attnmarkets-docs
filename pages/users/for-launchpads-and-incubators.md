# For Launchpads & Incubators

attnCredit can be embedded as a financing layer for projects with routed onchain fee flows.

## What attn provides

- revenue-account setup patterns,
- policy-bounded credit facilities,
- automated repayment servicing,
- lender-grade monitoring outputs,
- lane-aware capital allocation.

## Why it fits launchpads

- projects get faster access to working capital,
- repayment is enforced via routed fees,
- risk controls are transparent to capital providers,
- facilities can scale with observed performance.

## Integration model

1. Verify project fee-routing readiness.
2. Configure vault/control policy.
3. Apply underwriting and lane assignment.
4. Start servicing and reporting loops.

## Risk and operations expectations

- mandatory paydown and utilization discipline,
- dynamic limit updates under changing revenue,
- deterministic throttle/freeze/default controls,
- no early commingling between high-volatility and conservative sleeves.
