# For Liquidity Providers

attnCredit gives LPs exposure to revenue-swept credit facilities with explicit control policy and reporting.

## What you hold

LP exposure is organized by **credit pool**:

- **Pump credit pool:** higher yield, higher volatility, tighter controls.
- **Settlement credit pool:** conservative profile with stronger institutional requirements.

attnUSD reflects managed credit pool exposure and portfolio performance.

## Core protections

- hard sweeps from routed fees,
- dynamic borrowing base and cap policy,
- mandatory paydown discipline,
- deterministic throttle/freeze/default modes,
- lane-level concentration and reserve controls.

## No early commingling

Pump and Settlement credit pools are separate in early stages.
LPs should evaluate each credit pool independently.

## Lender-grade tape

LP reporting includes:

- facility-level balances and utilization,
- repayment and sweep performance,
- concentration and credit pool allocation,
- configuration-change logs,
- incidents, drills, and resolution timelines.

## Risk profile

- This is credit exposure, not principal-guaranteed yield.
- Losses and recoveries are reflected by credit pool composition.
- Higher yield credit pools carry higher control-event and volatility risk.

## Participation model

1. Select credit pool exposure policy.
2. Review risk and reporting standards.
3. Fund and monitor via recurring tape.
4. Rebalance as lane performance and mandate preferences change.
